# invariant_layers_cymetric
In this repo, we introduce non-trainable, group invariant layers for the phi-model in cymetric, which is a Python package for learning of Calabi-Yau metrics using neural networks implemented in TensorFlow: https://github.com/pythoncymetric/cymetric

ML models including these layers are discussed in our paper  https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.06914
